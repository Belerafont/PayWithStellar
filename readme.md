![marketplace](/marketplace.jpg)

## What is PayWithStellar?

**PayWithStellar** is a simple button that easily enables your website to receive payments in XLM Lumens, the currency used in the Stellar Network as the leading platform for world commerce.

## How to use it?

In order to use **PayWithStellar** on your site you need to follow these easy steps:

- Have a Stellar account with at least 1 XLM in funds
- Download the PayWithStellar.js file from here [future link]
- Download the PayWithStellar.jpg button image from here [future link] or design your own
- Add a click event to all your insta-pay buttons or to your checkout form at the end:
- [button onclick="PayWithStellar.payment(event, 950.00, 'YOURORDERID')"]
- Add confirm and cancel events to process your orders based on our response
- Add the PayWithStellar.js library at the end of your html code
- [script id="pay-with-stellar" mid="yourmerchantid*stellar.org" src="paywithstellar.js"]
- For more detailed information on how to set up your PayWithStellar button please refer to the merchant's guide [future link]

## Security first

We never ever ask for your secret key and you should never share it with anybody or enter it on any site. All the code will be available on Github for peer review so it can be fully scrutinized by security experts worldwide [future link].

Our library only checks for payments and when it finds a new one it validates it against the order ID and the amount, if they match the payment is considered valid and confirmed so you can proceed with the checkout while your customers never leave your site.

## How much will it cost?

Nothing. If you are a web developer and have basic html and javascript knowledge you can do it all by yourself in less than ten minutes. If you need help we will setup a site offering services for merchants like email confirmation, transaction explorer, orders and fulfillment, tracking, stats, etc. and we will charge the lowest fees in the market.

## Ok, I'm interested, what now?

Wait for the public announcement while we finish testing and improving the libraries for all possible scenarios. Security is the most important aspect and we take it very seriously.

Come back soon!

## Can I use that cool button in my own site?

Sure! Go ahead and spread the love for Stellar, the world will be a better place if we all do, what's not to love about instant purchases and strict security in a highly reliable platform like the Stellar Network? Become one of the first merchants to offer the Stellar gateway in your site and enjoy the benefits of instant payments right now.
